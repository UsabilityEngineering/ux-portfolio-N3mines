# Morning Coffee

It’s the morning and time for another cup of coffee to get the day started.  As I go digging around to find my Moms’ old espresso machine I end up finding myself with the question of “how do I use this thing?”.  For someone who’s experienced in making espresso it might be trivial, but for someone who is used to a Keurig coffee maker, this machine is very foreign.  I can guess where coffee beans might go, and figure out where the water is placed with the nice message on top of the dome-looking lid, but that’s really all you initially get.
