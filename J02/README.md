# Morning Coffee

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the morning and time for another cup of coffee to get the day started.  As I go digging around to find my Moms’ old espresso machine I end up finding myself with the question of “how do I use this thing?”.  For someone who’s experienced in making espresso it might be trivial, but for someone who normally uses a Keurig coffee maker, this machine is very foreign.  I can guess where coffee beans might go, and figure out where the water is placed with the nice message on top of the dome-looking lid, but that’s really all I initially understood.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I look closer by rotating the handle pointing toward myself, I find the little cup to put coffee beans.  Looking again, I can kinda make out the ***Affordance*** setting on the dial with the little images that look like a cup of coffee and steam.  The only issue is that I don’t know how to turn on this device or what steam and coffee cup settings do.  With a little fiddling, I figure out that turning the dial up or down turns on a light, and starts the sound of water heating up.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning the dial to the coffee cup and waiting, you’ll get espresso coming out of the little cup of coffee beans and you’re ready to start your day and head off to start zoom class.  One issue is presented in this process though, the compressed hot water is still sitting there waiting to be released.  The ***Safety*** of this is not the best as I release the sealed lid on top and promptly get burnt by piping hot steam.  Through more trial and error, I eventually figure out the technique of turning the dial slightly to the steam side to release the pressure.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fix this design up I think the espresso machine should be changed a little bit with 0 being replaced with OFF, and possibly adding a pressure release button to avoid hurting the user when taking the airtight lid off.  By adding OFF, you would make the machine more ***Learnable*** since I would know where to look when I tried to turn the device on in the first place.  Next, a pressure release button would make things a lot ***Safer*** as the user would avoid getting burnt by steam.  At the end of the day though, the ***Satisfaction*** of a nice cup of espresso is hard to beat. <br />
